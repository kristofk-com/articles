2021 book #5: Unscripted (MJ DeMarco)

This book is written on the presumption that ordinary life is not good and that happiness is freedom. Freedom from obligations so that you can get back to doing ordinary stuff unburdened. From a cultural standpoint, it is very clear that the book is written from an American point of view and the advice is most applicable in the US as the social safety net is different from say Europe (e.g. student loan, healthcare, pension).

The author expands on his ideas from his previous books: The Millionaire Fastlane. The tone of the book is emotionally charged and persuasive. This will alienate some and fire up others but looking beyond the presentation the contents are fine.

I'm not entirely sure who this book is aimed at, as it is too long to be a quick introduction to entrepreneurship and it is too shallow to be a reference guide to becoming an entrepreneur. I guess the target audience is people who are in pursuit of wealth and freedom but don't know where to start.

The book touches on lessons from other well-established books like Ownership from Extreme ownership and some light startup advice from The Lean Startup. However, it doesn't go in-depth and so it is still better to read these 2 books separately.

I wouldn't recommend this book to those who have already chosen the path of entrepreneurship as it doesn't go into practical details.

I would recommend this book to those who are thinking of ideas like passive income, starting businesses, and financial freedom.
