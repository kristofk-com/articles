title: The Ultimate List of News Sources for Apple Developers
tags: Generic
---

I‚Äôll be covering sources from where you can get news, success stories, interviews, tips & tricks and much more. Some of these resources are visual, some are auditorial and some are just plain text. There will be links to each source.

The inspiration for this post comes from a blog post over at Medium about the best newsletters iOS Developers should subscribe to. Then I taught why not expand the article so that it covers every information source for devs in the Apple ecosystem.

Also, on Simple[Programmer.com](http://Programmer.com) the most popular blog post is the ultimate list of podcasts for developers and I‚Äôm gunning for the same thing here except for Apple devs and not all the developers.

Before I start let me just give a quick shout out for [JP](https://www.jeanpierredevilliers.com). He‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about if you don‚Äôt know who JP is then I‚Äôd highly recommend you check him out.

# Forums

## Reddit

### [IOSProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/)

![reddit - ios programming](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/reddit-iosprogramming-min.png)

This subreddit is the hub for iOS devs, articles, questions and news get published here by devs. There is also a weekly job board which is not so popular as not many jobs get posted there but it is there none the less. The questions asked here are not necessarily technical, they can be about career, business, marketing and sales that connect in some way to iOS development.

### [Swift](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/)

![reddit - swift](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/reddit-swift-min.png)

This subreddit is much more technical and it doesn‚Äôt have as many subscribers as IOSProgramming but it is a great resource too. Questions and articles are posted alike and new libraries are mentioned occasionally. If you already read Reddit then you might as well subscribe to this subreddit too.

## [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

![stack overflow](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/stack-overflow-min.png)

I‚Äôm only featuring Stack Overflow here because it is the most popular QA style website in the dev community. I personally don‚Äôt like the fact that people over on Stack Overflow are not nice at all especially if you are a developer. I suggest you make a fake account and asking questions with that as it is very likely that your first few accounts will be banned because of the bad questions. As to what counts as bad questions is yet unknown to me. I am burning through my 3rd fake account and I still don‚Äôt understand why people downvote and why the site blocks your access.

# Podcasts

For the podcast, there is a Blog post on Simple [Programmer.com](http://Programmer.com) **The Ultimate List Of Developer Podcasts**. This is a great blog post but it is too general. I am here to address Apple devs while this blog post would include us in Mobile development. Another great blog post is the **Great Podcasts for iOS Developers** over at [mikebuss.com](http://mikebuss.com). This is more specific, but it mentions a lot of podcasts. So with all that here are my highlights.

## [Core Intuition](https://coreint.org)

![core int](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930834/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/core-intuition-min.png)

This podcast is on everybody‚Äôs top list. It has surpassed 300 episodes not that long ago. According to the hosts Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece this podcast is ‚Äúa podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies.‚Äù Meaning that this podcast has it all, mostly higher level topics with a bunch of tomfooleries.

## [Release Notes](https://releasenotes.tv)

![release notes](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930835/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/release-notes-min.png)

If you are tired of all the tech jargon then this podcast is for you. Charles Perry and Joe Cieplinski discuss the business, marketing, trends and much more about apps. Everything but the code. They also tell success and failure stories.

## [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com)

![developing perspective](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930834/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/developing-perspective-min.png)

This is great if you want to just catch a quick break between pomodori. This podcast is never longer than 15minutes and the host shares his experience and Apple news.

### [SwiftCoders](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com)

![swift coders](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/swift-coders-min.png)

This is a podcast all about interviews. Many great developers, content creators and business owners that are in touch with Apple development and Swift are interviewed about their story. This is great if you would like to get inspiration about where to go next in your career.

# YouTube

### [Sean Allen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbTw29mcP12YlTt1EpUaVJw?spfreload=10)

![youtube - sean allen](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/sean-allen-min.png)

Sean Allen has a great YouTube channel, it strikes a great balance between lifestyle and vlogs and technical topics and programming. He has an interview series which really kickstarted his channel. Sean is well known for sharing his contracting experience and stories. He also shares how his days go so you get an insight into a contracting developers lifestyle which is the goal of the channel.

### [Lets build that app](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA?spfreload=10)

![youtube - letsbuild that app](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/lets-build-that-app-min.png)

The channel is hosted by Brian Voong and this channel is very technical. If you need a tutorial or if you want to know how to do something in Swift, this is a place to go. Brian is a very experienced developer and he can build some amazing shit, he demos how to build UIs of popular apps like YouTube and Instagram. He also does animation tutorials. So if you want to spice up your app this is the channel to go to.

### [Brian Advent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCysEngjfeIYapEER9K8aikw?spfreload=10)

![youtube - brian advent](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930834/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/brian-advent-min.png)

Brian advent much like Lets build that app deals with very technical topics. However, these topics are usually smaller focusing on implementing one specific technology at a time e.g. CoreML and ARKit. If you want to keep up to date with Apple technologies and you want to learn theme quickly, this is the place.

### [The Swift guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-d1NWv5IWtIkfH47ux4dWA?spfreload=10)

![youtube - the swift guy](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930836/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/the-swift-guy-min.png)

The swift guy aka Sebastian Henry hosts a YouTube channel that is a mix of Lets build that app and Brian Advent. He makes videos about smaller projects, his latest one is about implementing a video player. He also does app reviews that his fans send in.

# Meetup

![meetup](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930835/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/meetup-min.png)

[meetup.com](http://meetup.com) is a great website where you can find local user groups for technologies. I live in Budapest in Hungary and the only user group here that is connected to Apple programming is NSBudapest. But in your area, you might find more user groups. If there are none, don‚Äôt panic as you still have the internet which can replace social interactions as we all know.

# Eventbrite

![eventbrite](https://res.cloudinary.com/kristofk-com/image/upload/v1566930834/kristofk-com/posts/2017-12-18-the-ultimate-list-of-resources-for-apple-developers/eventbrite-min-5a38197005b47.png)

[eventbride.com](https://www.eventbrite.com) is a website for events. Most events are listed on this website and they are filtered down based on your location and interests. I recommend you check this site once a week to see what events are happening so you can attend the ones that interests you. Events are great for socializing with other people and that is the primary reason I attend most events.
