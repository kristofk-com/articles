This week was the ?10th anniversary of the iPhone OS SDK?. On March 6\. 2008, Apple announced that they are going to allow 3rd party developers to use the same development tools as Apple does. This changed the lives of many. Not so much for me since I have only been a developer since the release of Swift but still this was a special event to look back on.

## An exhaustive guide to the Static keyword AKA Type methods in Swift SwiftCore

This week I made a video about the static keyword in Swift. It discusses all the use cases of it. This is part of my SwiftCore series in which I take a Swift concept and I explain it. You can find this content on my [website](https://old.kristofk.com//static-keyword-swift/) and on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60VWleORVQ5rBEt85oqErQ).
